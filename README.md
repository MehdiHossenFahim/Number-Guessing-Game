## 🕹️ Game Overview

The computer selects a random number between **1 and 100**, and your goal is to guess it correctly within a limited number of attempts.  

### 🎯 Difficulty Levels

| Difficulty | Attempts |
|-----------|----------|
| Easy      | 10       |
| Medium    | 5        |
| Hard      | 3        |

After each guess, the game will guide you:

- **Too high** → Number is smaller  
- **Too low** → Number is larger  

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌟 Multiple difficulty levels  
- 🔄 Replayable rounds  
- 🎯 Hints after every guess  
- 🧠 Builds logical thinking and intuition  
- 💻 Beginner-friendly Python project

## 💡 Example Gameplay

```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
You have 5 chances to guess the correct number.

Please select the difficulty level:
    1. Easy (10 chances)
    2. Medium (5 chances)
    3. Hard (3 chances)

Enter your choice: 2
Great! You have selected the Medium difficulty Level
Let's start the game!

Enter your guess: 50
Incorrect! The number is greater than 50.
Enter your guess: 75
Incorrect! The number is less than 75.

Congratulations! You guessed the correct number in 3 attempts.
Do you want to play again? (y) or (n): n
```
